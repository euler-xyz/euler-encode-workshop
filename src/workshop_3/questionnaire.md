## Workshop 3 Assignment:
1. How many sub-accounts does an Ethereum address have on the EVC? How are their addresses calculated?
(Answer: 256 sub-accounts, addresses of sub accounts are generated by XORing sub-account ID and owing address)

2. Does the sub-account system decrease the security of user accounts?
(Answer: No, it does not reduce the security of the user account; rather, it increases the security)

3. Provide a couple of use cases for the operator functionality of the EVC.
(Answer: Operators can be used as: Hot Wallet for Trading , Emergency Close-Out Contract and automate actions based on market conditions. )

4. What is the main difference between the operator and the controller?
(Answer: The primary distinction between an operator and a controller in the Ethereum Vault Connector (EVC) is that, whereas an account can only have one controller at a time, which has control over the collateral assets for purposes such as liquidation, each sub-account can install one or more operators who can perform a variety of actions on behalf of the account, such as trading or executing contracts based on market conditions. Additionally, unlike controllers, users can disable operators at any time.)

5. What does it mean to defer the account and vault status checks? What is the purpose of this deferral?
(Answer: Deferring account and vault status checks in the Ethereum Vault Connector means placing them in a queue to be verified later, typically at the end of a batch of operations. This deferral has two primary purposes: 1.It reduces gas costs.  2.It allows the checks to be temporarily violated mid-batch)

6. Why is it useful to allow re-entrancy for `call` and `batch` functions?
(Answer: Allowing re-entrancy for the 'call' and 'batch' functions in the Ethereum Vault Connector (EVC) is useful because it makes it easier to execute multiple contract invocations in batches. This approach enables atomic operations, deferred liquidity checking, and conditional checks, which improve the efficiency and flexibility of transaction processing.)

7. How does the simulation feature of the EVC work?
(Answer: The Ethereum Vault Connector's (EVC) simulation feature works by calling 'batchSimulation()' rather than the standard 'batch()' function. Unlike normal batch calls, which do not return any data to save gas, simulations process the return data from each item in the batch. This is accomplished by executing the batch, collecting the return data, and then returning with this data as error information. The process entails attempting to catch the exception and returning the resulting error data. This mechanism works even on nodes that may modify error data.)

8. Provide a couple of use cases for the `permit` functionality of the EVC.
(Answer: A. Enabling User Interfaces (UIs) Without Blockchain Transactions: It enables the creation of UIs that do not require users to create blockchain transactions themselves. Instead, they sign permit messages with a "tip" for whoever completes the transaction.
B. Conditional or Contingent Orders: Permit allows for "resting" orders, which are permit messages that remain in a mempool until specific conditions are met. These conditions can be time-based (before or after a specific time), price-based (related to the asset being traded or other assets), or based on any other on-chain metric such as volatility.â€‹)

9. What is the purpose of the nonce namespace?
(Answer: The nonce namespace in the Ethereum Vault Connector (EVC) creates separate "streams" of execution for orders. This enables conditions that check the status of other namespaces to "merge" streams together. It is especially useful in managing unrelated transactions, where the strict nonce-order of Ethereum transactions may be counterproductive, such as with sub-accounts and contingent orders.)

10. Why should the EVC neither be given any privileges nor hold any tokens?
(Answer: Maintaining Neutrality: As a neutral facilitator, it prevents any potential abuse or exploitation of its capabilities. This is critical in decentralized systems where trust is an essential component.

Minimizing Security Risks: This approach significantly lowers security risks. Without tokens or extensive privileges, the EVC is less vulnerable to malicious attacks, improving overall system security.)
