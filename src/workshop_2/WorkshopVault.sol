    // [ANSWER]: 
    // If the account's status is unchanged or already verified, further checks are redundant.
    // For operations that don't affect the account's state, such as read-only actions.
    // To optimize for gas efficiency and execution speed when status checks are irrelevant.

    // [ASSIGNMENT]: is the vault status check always necessary? why?
    // [ANSWER]:
    // Essential for maintaining vault's state integrity and security, especially in state-changing transactions.

    // Crucial for ensuring compliance with risk management protocols and regulatory standards.

    // Might not suffice for direct authentication in borrow-related operations.
    // Additional verification methods required to ensure proper permissions and criteria are met.

    // [ASSIGNMENT]: if the answer to the above is "no", how this function could be modified to allow safe borrowing?
    // [ANSWER]:
    // Implement additional checks to authenticate and validate the borrowerâ€™s identity and eligibility.
    // Ensure the borrowing account has the necessary permissions and meets borrowing criteria.
    // Modify to incorporate context-specific logic, considering both EVC and direct call scenarios.
