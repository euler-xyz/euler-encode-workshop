    // This modifier is designed to replicate the behavior of always invoking the vault through the EVC, using the Callback pattern. This ensures predictable behavior of the vault and the use of other EVC features.
    // Functionalities like patching, sub-accounts operators,etc; wouldn't be accessible. 
    // Additionally, this design choice helps mitigate security concerns, such as re-entrancy attacks.

    // Yes, it is necessary to check the vault status for security and risk management purposes and avoid putting users funds at risk.
